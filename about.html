<p>Hello, my name is Victoria Bockman and I am a senior at the University of Colorado Boulder majoring in Computer Science and graduating in May of 2024. I have a passion for software development and the field of cybersecurity. 

  Throughout my years in school, I have honed my skills in various software development languages, mastering both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Through hands-on projects, I've gained experience in building scalable applications and websites, debugging intricate code, and collaborating with my peers.
  
  Most recently, I’ve worked on a project to graph the healthcare supply chain, integrating AI capabilities to enhance and suggest new connections within the graph and visualize the trends in recent years to prepare for healthcare emergencies. This project not only sharpened my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the real-world implications of technology in critical sectors.
  
  I’ve been working with a great team at a local distillery for the past three years, creating invaluable connections within my local community and leveraging my creativity to enhance the brand. Outside of school, I am a true Colorado native at heart. I’ve been snowboarding and hiking for as long as I can remember, and I take every moment I can to enjoy what this area offers.
  
  As I prepare to embark on the next chapter of my journey, I am eager to use my diverse skill set and hands-on experiences to secure an internship opportunity where I can collaborate with like-minded individuals on meaningful projects. I am driven by a curiosity and a commitment to making a positive impact in the tech industry, and I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
