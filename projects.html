  <h3>Mancala Simulation</h3>
    <h4>Class: Introduction to AI</h4>
  <p>
    For this project, I worked alone to simulate the game Mancala using Python. The specifics of
this project included creating an AI player that uses the algorithm Minimax to pick the best
available option for gameplay. The other player picked a random option during their turn. We
also explored the use of alpha-beta pruning to optimize the minimax function. Then, simulations
were run to test the win/loss ratio between the two players, as I increased the depth of the
minimax function.

  <h3>Adventure game</h3>
    <h4>Class: Object Oriented Analysis and Design</h4>
  <p>
    This was a semester-long project that was updated every few weeks to include different
    elements. I worked with a partner throughout the entire project. Written in Java, we used a
    variety of different OO Design Priciples. The game was set up to include multiple players that
    had different ways they moved through the game or floor plan, and a variety of tests to
    determine end of game scenarios. Game simulations were ran and a report printed.

  <h3>Stratego Simulation</h3>
    <h4>Class: Object Oriented Analysis and Design</h4>
  <p>
    I worked with a partner for this project. We had creative freedom for what we wanted this project
to entail and decided to create a simulation of the game Stratego. Again, this was written in
Java and we had to utilize a variety of OO Design Principles. For this game, we recreated the
gameplay and the different ways pieces were able to move. We then visualized the game board
and created a user interface for gameplay.

  <h3>Graphing the Healthcare Suppply Chain</h3>
    <h4>Class: Software Engineering Project</h4>
  <p>
    For this project, I am working with five
other people to graph the healthcare supply chain for the company GHX. We are ingesting huge
data files with product/supplier information into a knowledge graph, applying AI techniques to
suggest new or updated connections within the graph, and visualizing the data and query scripts
using Neo4J. We have scripts written in Cypher, as well as Python and Gremlin code for the
main software.
